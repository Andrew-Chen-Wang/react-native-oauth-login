### Introduction

This project is educational for me in creating an OAuth consumer.
This React Native repository demonstrates both signing up and
logging in via the app alone.

This project uses my tutorial on a custom Django OAuth provider
and consumer. If you'd like to test this project, run the
provider and mobile consumer at this project:
https://github.com/Andrew-Chen-Wang/django-social-provider-and-consumer-tutorial

Why create this? I have a custom OAuth provider. I wanted to create 
an OAuth consumer for a new project called [Hear Ye](https://hearye.us/).
